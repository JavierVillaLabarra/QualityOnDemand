## Sub Project Management

* Next meeting on August 25th

## Open Issues (including backlog)

* [#199 QoD 0.9 - inline documentation problem](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/199)
  - Proposal to include link to Swagger editor or ReDoc formatted version of the API specification within the release notes
  - General agreement that this was a good idea
  - Decisions
    - Add inline links to Swagger and Redoc formatted version of API definition to both release notes and README.md (for latest release)
    - Raise with Commonalties to make this a requirement for all APIs
    - Eric to request Herbert update release notes and README for QoD

* [#158 Add linting GitHub actions](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/158)
  - Agreed that this was a good time to test linting on v0.10.0-wip before this is further modified
  - Randy to look to implement this first for simple formatting update (prettifying) to understand how linting tools can be applied to the repository
  - Randy believes he now has sufficient permissions for this, but will otherwise contact Herbert

* [#194 Add Application Function Id (afId) or Sponsor Id](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/194) Discussion points (to be continues within the issue):
  - Main use would be to relate usage data from the network to a specific application of the API customer. Relevant for API customers who have different applications or application functions which they want to monitor regarding usage seperately. Assumption is that the application information will not come with the access token (as that would require different access token per application).
  - This functionality (add application ID to the API call) might be relevant across several CAMARA APIs -> potentially issue to be opened in Commonalities.
  - Syed gave a [presentation](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/6d6cca9162f491db6b5ff501d1bce80ece0ab900/documentation/SupportingDocuments/Presentations/Sponsor%20or%20App%20Id%20proposal.pptx) on this issue. The following clarifications and comments were made:
    - Relationship between API consumer Id, application server IP address, and proposed appId is not necessarily one-to-one
      - API consumer may be managing multiple application servers
      - Application servers may have more than one IP address, or share a single IP address with multiple applications
    - An alternative to explicitly identifying the application by appId would be for each application to be identified by a separate OAuth key / token
      - For some API consumers, however, this could be unmanageable
      - This solution would also be effectively proprietary, requiring the OAuth key identity to be extracted and passed to the API using, for example, a header
    - If an explicit appId was passed via the API, validating this would be an issue
      - Some workflow examples of appId validation and error cases would be useful
    - For mobile networks, appId would map to afId of NEF. There is no equivalent mapping for fixed networks, so use of appId would likely be proprietary.
    - Accessing records by appId would remain proprietary for each API implementor, with no plans to introduce additional CAMARA APIs for this
  - Decisions:
    - Syed to make proposal on how appId would be introduced into the QoD API definition, and to give additional details on how it would be validated and used.

* [#147 Extend the query capabilities for Qos Profiles](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/147)
Two options seen in discussion:
  * Use of comparisation operators on attributes. For that a definition in Commonalities (how to express in OAS) is pending. Challenge: need to be applied to complex object
  * Additional GET endpoint which delivers based on a profile object with required/desired parameters a list of QoD profiles which are fulfilling the required quality parameters (if existing). This would require a specific comparisation logic. GraphQL could be a blueprint, but QoD sub project should introduce that only if there is broader demand across CAMARA sub project. Discussion to be continued within issue.<br><br>

* [#173 Add support for DSCP markings for QoD sessions](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/173)
See comments within issue. Probably no change to the API, only relevant for implementation of certain profiles. Discussion to be continued within the issue.

* [#101 List endpoint for active sessions of authenticated user](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/101)
Nice to have functionality for developers. Requires to maintain relation of QoD session resources to resource owner based (based on access token). Should if possible get part of v0.10.0. therefore backlog label deleted.

* [#47 Include support for /PATCH sessions](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/47)
PR #162 open. Agreed to implement first a minimum patch operation as described in comments. Behaviour behind patch of `duration` to be discussed first within the issue. Potentially an own endpoint necessary if the behaviour doesn't fit to a PATCH operation.

* [#31 Ensure secure handling of callback URL](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/31)
To be replaced by an issue to adapt to changes out of #8 in Commonalities

* [#45 Need to support ability to configure fallback qos](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/45)
Most potential customers are ok with a fallback to "default" class of QoS. Notion that implementation would be complex (at the moment) but limited market demand. To be kept in backlog.

* [#51 Proposal of IpFlowDescription to allow asymmetric QoS flows and (re)introduce protocol definitions](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/51)
Syed mentioned the need to describe flows also with the protocol type (TCP, UDP). Use case examples to be added as comments. Might not require the introduction of IPFlowDescriptions. Decision if to pull from backlog based later.

* [#166 Extend QoS Profile queries to list profiles based on specific users or devices](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/166)
Missed to discuss => next call

## Open PRs

* [#171 First pass for including linting for pull requests](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/171)
  Randy will split the PR into several smaller PRs to introduce linting step by step

* [#162 Add PATCH operation](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/162)
  See discussion of issue #47 (update: changed status of PR to "draft" as we first want to discuss the logic behind patching `duration`)


## API Roadmap

### Release 0.10.0

* September-October 2023? (as for DeviceStatus 0.6.0)
* Focus on stabilization of API definition, e.g. introduction of linting
* Changes expected from Authn/Authz discussion in Identity & Consent and from Notifiation/Subscription in Commonalities
* New features so far based on discussed issues
  * [#47 Include support for /PATCH sessions](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/47) (minimal set of attributes which can be patched)
  * [#101 List endpoint for active sessions of authenticated user](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/101) (incl authorization concept)
  * [#147 Extend the query capabilities for Qos Profiles](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/147)


## AOB

* QoD maintainers are reqquested to actively support the resolution of issues which the sub project raised in Commonalities.
* The next call will be on August 25th, 2 PM CEST / 12:00 UTC
